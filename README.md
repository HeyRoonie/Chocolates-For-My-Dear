## Hanzito needs your help! 
After a week of preping gifts for Colecito, Hanzito has been dry out of brain juices. 
He calls for you to help him arrange a lovely set of chocolate box and perfect love letter for his beloved.

Chocolates for My Dear is a short, interactive web game where you drag and drop chocolates into a chocolate box and pick lovely phrases to make a love letter. It is only available for desktop users as of the moment since this is my first front-end web dev project and have not figure out how to make responsive websites. Furthermore, this is made with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS.
